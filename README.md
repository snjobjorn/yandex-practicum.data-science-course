# yandex-practicum.data-science-course
Here there are all educational projects I completed during my data sciense course in Yandex.Practicum. They are divided into folders. Each of them consists of .ipynb, .html (that you can easily open and look at in web-browser) and .csv dataset file. In the core folder of this repository there is a diploma/certificate of course completion.
